The better install/configuration documents are available at:
http://pyicq-t.jabberstudio.org/

There's really not much to the install at the moment.  It's important
to make sure you have the following installed:

- Jabber ;D
- Python
- Twisted (www.twistedmatrix.com)
- Optional: nevow (http://www.nevow.org/) for web interface

Then, go into the src directory and copy config_example.py to config.py and
edit config.py.  Change the jid to the Jabber ID you want this transport to
answer as.  Change mainServer to the IP address or DNS name of your Jabber
server.  Change secret to the shared secret between transports and your
Jabber server (should be in router.xml for Jabberd2).  Change port to the
port this transport is to connect to (also found in router.xml for Jabberd2).
Edit other options at your leisure, they are fairly self-documented.

If you are migrating from JIT, you can copy over your spool directory into
the same directory that this INSTALL file is.  (make the jid field is set to
the same name as this spool directory)  If you are starting a fresh spool
directory, simply mkdir the same name you used in the jid field.  Note that
you can set the actual location of the spool directory if you want, instead
of having to put it in this directory.

With Jabberd2, there's little else you need to do than run PyICQt in this
directory.  It's important to know that you should -not- have an alias
line in your router.xml for PyICQ-t.

Note: the following instructions are provided almost word for word from
James Bunton, just modified for ICQ.  ;)

With Jabberd1, you need to add something like the following to jabber.xml:
<service id="icq.host.com">
	<host>icq.host.com</host>
	<accept>
		<ip>127.0.0.1</ip>
		<port>XXXX</port>
		<secret>secret</secret>
	</accept>
</service>

Check that icq.host.com is the same as the 'jid' setting from config.py
and that XXXX is the same as the 'port' setting. Also 'secret' must
correspond, and the 'mainServer' setting should be pointing to the same
interface as the <ip/> tag is (in this example the loopback interface is
used. So 'mainServer' would be '127.0.0.1').

You must also add this to the browse section of your jabber.xml file

<service type="icq" jid="icq.host.com" name="ICQ Transport">
	<ns>jabber:iq:register</ns>
</service>

Once again, icq.host.com must correspond to the 'jid' setting in config.py

Once you have made all these changes, restart your Jabberd1.4.x server,
then start PyICQt and it should all work.

I'll have better instructions and such at some point when we're further
along.
