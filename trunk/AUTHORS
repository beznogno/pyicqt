Daniel Henninger:
All plugin pieces to interact with ICQ.

James Bunton:
Created all of the base Jabber code and made it wonderfully pluggable enough
to adopt to other protocols.  =)

Also, thanks to:
Paul Clegg for helping me figure out how to make use of some of the oscar
functionality, and for his initial discussions with the Twisted Matrix team.

Jonas Adahl for pointing out an endian issue and providing a patch.  Also
for enhancing ICQ user information retrieval (vcard).

Magnus Henoch for discovering and fixing the problem with interaction
with ejabberd.

The Twisted Matrix development team who have put together this wonderful
framework we are making use of.  =)  I'd like to especially thank
Paul Swartz <z3p@twistedmatrix.com> for his work on the oscar.py piece and
for working with me to get various pieces working correctly!
