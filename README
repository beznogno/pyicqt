     ICQ Transport for Jabber, implemented with Python and Twisted


ICQ portions written by Daniel Henninger
Jabber portions written by James Bunton
(ie: this is based on PyMSNt's code)

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

Current I have:
- ability to register with the transport
- ability to log in and out of icq via the transport
- ability to send and receive messages
  - no 'composing' events functionality yet
  - no 'xhtml' components yet (ie, non-straight text messages)
  (both of these need to be added to James's base code)
- ability to set away status
- ability to add to and remove from your server side buddy list
- it actually can use the spool that JIT uses
- support for roster import (adding ICQ buddies to your jabber roster)

See TODO for things that aren't complete.

Please be aware that, at this time, you are required to log in via a real
ICQ client first.  Initial logins with an ICQ client create a base group
that the transport uses.  I haven't worked out the logistics of creating
the base group yet.
