If you are use MySQL as XDB backend, after upgrade you will get exception `"Table 'pyicqt.csettings' doesn't exist"`. Reason - some tables were added and used in new version.
Necessary manually create these tables.

{{{
mysql --host=localhost --user=pyicqt --password=pyicqt pyicqt
mysql> \. db-setup.mysql
}}}
