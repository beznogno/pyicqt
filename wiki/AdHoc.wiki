#summary End user PyICQt settings & commands

PyICQt supports different settings for every user. You can change them via Ad-Hoc menu (most jabber clients can do it)

=== Statistics for PyICQt menu ===
You can see statistics for transport here
 * Online Users
 * Incoming Messages
 * Uptime
 * Total Sessions
 * Max Concurrent Sessions
 * Outgoing Messages

=== Set x-status menu ===
Using this menu you can choose x-status and fill details for it
Choosing is 2-steps process:
  # Selection x-status name from list
  # Entering text for x-status title and description
List of x-status names contains not only predefined statuses for English version of official ICQ client, but also and statuses from other localizations. Not all clients supports all these x-statuses, thereby minor statuses (from Angry to Typing) more preferred than major (all other)

=== Settings menu ===
This menu contains several categories

*Contact list settings*

  * Show temporary ICQ contacts in roster
When you deleting contact from your ICQ contact list, it not deleting really, but marked as deleted and become 'temporary' contact. It's server feature and made by speed reasons as I think (may be you deleted contact by mistake and after some time will restore it - all this time contact 'cached' in your contact list).In most cases users shouldn't see these contacts. But when contact list on server corrupted, or user manually deleted all contacts from own list and want restore them back, it can be useful.
Numbers of temporary contacts usually much more than numbers of real contacts (for me 141 vs 54) and getting them from server can take a long time. 
If you enable this feature, you must re-login in PyICQt for applying changes.
If you enabled and after disabled this feature, PyICQt don't will erase temporary contacts from your roster and you must delete them manually or re-register in PyICQt

*X-status settings*

Note: administrator of PyICQt may disable x-status support for all users 
  * Support for x-status receiving
If this option enabled, you can receive x-status messages from your contacts (if client of contact can supports x-statuses)
If value changed from 'on' to 'off', option works immediately. If other case you can see x-status messages from contacts when they changed their states
  * Support for x-status sending
If this option enabled, your contacts can see your x-status message.
If option disabled, you can't set own x-status
  * Restore latest x-status after disconnect
When you don't want change x-status long time, you can pick this option, and your latest x-status will automatically set after connecting to ICQ network

*Personal events settings*

PyICQt try represent ICQ x-status for contacts as PEP event (you can read more about it at ExtendedStatus page) and uses for this aim 3 things: mood, activity and tune.
Unfortunately, not all jabber-clients understands these things, and you can choose only some things, which supported by your client.
Most of clients supports moods and tune, supports of activity in most cases don't ready yet (seems only Jabbim and Tkabber can display this in stable version, Gajim and Miranda only in unstable builds)

  * User mood receiving

  * User activity receiving

  * User tune receiving 

_NOTE:_ It's global settings for user. If you connected to PyICQt with two and more resources, option apply for all them
