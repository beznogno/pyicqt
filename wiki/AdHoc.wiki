#summary End user PyICQt settings & commands

PyICQt supports different settings for every user. You can change them via Ad-Hoc menu (most jabber clients can do it)

=== Statistics for PyICQt menu ===
You can see statistics for transport here
 * Online Users
 * Incoming Messages
 * Uptime
 * Total Sessions
 * Max Concurrent Sessions
 * Outgoing Messages

=== Set x-status menu ===
Using this menu you can choose x-status and fill details for it
Choosing is 2-steps process:
  # Selection x-status name from list
  # Entering text for x-status title and description
List of x-status names contains not only predefined statuses for English version of official ICQ client, but also and statuses from other localizations. Not all clients supports all these x-statuses, thereby minor statuses (from Angry to Typing) more preferred than major (all other)

=== Settings menu ===
This menu contains several categories

*Contact list settings*

  * Show temporary ICQ contacts in roster
When you deleting contact from your ICQ contact list, it not deleting really, but marked as deleted and become 'temporary' contact. It's server feature and made by speed reasons as I think (may be you deleted contact by mistake and after some time will restore it - all this time contact 'cached' in your contact list).In most cases users shouldn't see these contacts. But when contact list on server corrupted, or user manually deleted all contacts from own list and want restore them back, it can be useful.
Numbers of temporary contacts usually much more than numbers of real contacts (for me 141 vs 54) and getting them from server can take a long time. 
If you enable this feature, you must re-login in PyICQt for applying changes.
If you enabled and after disabled this feature, PyICQt don't will erase temporary contacts from your roster and you must delete them manually or re-register in PyICQt

  * Deny all authorization requests
Don't send subscription messages from ICQ contacts to jabber-client. This option useful for spam protection. All users requested authorization will receive 'Request denied' answer.


*X-status settings*

_NOTE:_ administrator of PyICQt may disable x-status support for all users
  * Away messages sending
Send status messages when your status 'away', 'n/a', or 'busy'. Sending of status messages in 'online' or 'free for chat' don't supported (and it's ICQ issue)
  * Away messages receiving
When this option enabled, you can see status messages (_away_ messages) from your contacts.
  * X-status sending mode.
If this option enabled, your contacts can see your x-status message.
If option disabled, you can't set own x-status
Value of option is mode of sending (like _ICQ 5.1_, _ICQ 6_ or combination).
After changing of mode you should re-login into transport
  * Restore latest x-status after disconnect
When you don't want change x-status long time, you can pick this option, and your latest x-status will automatically set after connecting to ICQ network
  * X-status receiving mode
If this option enabled, you can receive x-status messages from your contacts (if client of contact supports x-statuses).
If value changed to 'None', option works immediately. If other cases you can see x-status messages from contacts when they changed their states.
Value is one from _ICQ 5.1_, _ICQ 6_ and _ICQ 5.1+6_ (check ExtendedStatus page for full information about these modes)
  * Allow status icons between 5.1 and 6
When you selected 5.1 or 6 in previous option, you can't see x-status information from clients, which uses other mode. With this option enabled you can see x-status name (icon) for these contacts
  * Display status icon as personal event
Possibility see x-status icons for contacts. Jabber-client with PEP support required, and it should may display PEP event as icon.

_NOTE:_ Icons for all activities (60+) don't created yet, and impossible see icons for all x-statuses now 
  * Try display status text as personal event
Very funny option :) Your contact can put name of mood or activity in x-status title and you will see PEP icon for this name. In current realization works only when _ICQ 6_ or _ICQ 5.1+6_ mode of x-status receiving enabled   
  * Display status icon for transport (some client only)
As least Gajim can draw in roster PEP icons for all contacts, including transports. Option uses this feature for displaying your own icon (i.e. icon for your x-status name)

*Message settings*

  * utf-8 messages sending mode
Send messages in utf-8 when:

...contact supports utf-8 messages (_Always when it's possible_)

...contact really uses utf-8 (_As reply on incoming utf-8 message_)

...never (_Sending disabled_)

  * Confirmations sending mode
Send confirmations on incoming messages when:

...contact can receive them (_Always_)

...contact uses modern ICQ client (_Only for utf-8 messages_)

...never (_Sending disabled_)

  * Confirmations receiving
Sends requests for messages confirmations. It's works when your jabber-client can send such requests (Bombus, for example) and contact's client can response on requests

*Personal events settings*

PyICQt try represent ICQ x-status for contacts as PEP event (you can read more about it at ExtendedStatus page) and uses for this aim 3 things: mood, activity and tune.
Unfortunately, not all jabber-clients understands these things, and you can choose only some things, which supported by your client.
Most of clients supports moods and tune, supports of activity in most cases don't ready yet (seems only Jabbim and Tkabber can display this in stable version, Gajim and Miranda only in unstable builds)

  * User mood receiving

  * User activity receiving

  * User tune receiving

Clients supports personal events since versions:
|| Client || Mood || Activity || Tune ||
