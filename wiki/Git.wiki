#summary Latest PyICQt's updates via git

= Introduction =

Git is a distributed version control system. It's in much times faster and flexible one than SVN, therefore used now for PyICQt development 


= Details =

Do you want get updates directly from git repo?
It's not a problem

*Branches*

unstable - main branch for testing

master - latest stable version (currently _0.8.1_). Recommended for use

oldstable - previous stable version (currently _0.8_).  

*Initial actions*

First, clone repo and place it content in _pyicqt_ folder, for example:
{{{
git clone git://gitorious.org/pyicqt/mainline.git pyicqt
}}}

Ok, you have full copy of PyICQt. Let's enter in just created folder
{{{
cd pyicqt
}}}

Jump to _update_ section if you want use only stable version. In other case read next.

Now you should select separate branches, which necessary for you:
{{{
git branch --track unstable origin/unstable
}}}

After this initial clone you tracks _unstable_ branch. 

For switching from one branch to other (_unstable_ here) type:
{{{ 
git checkout unstable
}}}

*Update*

For updating you should run only one command:
{{{
git pull
}}}

And it's all. Enjoy!
