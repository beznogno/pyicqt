#summary Roadmap for PyICQt administartors

= Introduction =

You want set up own PyICQt installation, but don't know which should be first step? I hope this page can help make it


= Details =

  # Installation of transport require machine with some software. Check versions on your system. Tested as least with:
    * Python - 2.4..2.5
    * Twisted - 2.5..8.1
  # Then jabber server needed. I'm use [http://ejabberd.im ejabberd], but you can select any from 10+, listed on [http://xmpp.org/software/servers.shtml this page]. Documentation for server comes with it
  # PyICQt self can be downloaded from this site (see [http://code.google.com/p/pyicqt/downloads/list Downloads] section) or pulled from repository of your distribution
  # Configure interaction between server and transport (manual for ejabberd [http://www.ejabberd.im/pyicqt here])
  # Done? Now restart them and try connect to own jabber server with [http://www.jabber.org/web/Clients jabber client] and make service discovery. If you see transport and it responses on yours requests - configuration was successful
  # No more installation steps. Only documentation [http://code.google.com/p/pyicqt/wiki/UserStartPage for users]

= Other? =
  * [OnlineDocumentation] - more comprehensive documentation, but partially out-of-date
  * [Monitor] - monitoring of a transport state
